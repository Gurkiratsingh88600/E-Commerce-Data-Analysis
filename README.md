# Power BI E-Commerce Analytics Case Study

## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI-based analytics project for an e-commerce client, focusing on customer behavior analysis and deriving actionable insights through dashboards. The project leverages two datasets—`Sales_Data_Ecommerce` and `Promotions`—to address key business questions related to pricing, promotions, search behavior, and key performance indicators (KPIs). The analysis aims to provide insights into customer interactions, sales trends, and the impact of promotions.

## Objectives
The goal is to create interactive Power BI dashboards under the following themes:
- **Overview KPIs**: Revenue, potential revenue, product, and category metrics.
- **Pricing & Promotions**: Analyze price variations and promotion impacts.
- **Search & Recommendations**: Understand search behavior and brand preferences.

Additionally, the project answers:
1. Variables derived from the data for enhanced insights.
2. Target audience for the dashboards.
3. Value generated by the dashboards.
4. Additional data to improve insights.

## Dataset
The datasets cover two months of customer behavior:
1. **Sales_Data_Ecommerce**:
   - **Columns**: `user_id`, `event_date`, `Day_of_Week`, `Channel` (App/Browser), `event_time`, `event_hour`, `event_timezone`, `event_type` (view, cart, purchased), `product_id`, `category_id`, `category`, `sub_category1`, `sub_category2`, `brand`, `price`, `user_session`, `State`, `User_Score` (customer segmentation).
   - **Description**: Captures customer interactions (views, cart additions, purchases).
2. **Promotions**:
   - **Columns**: `Promotion Id`, `Date`, `Discount%`, `ProductId`.
   - **Description**: Details special promotions displayed on the app/website’s first page.

## Business Questions
The dashboards address the following questions (non-exhaustive):
1. How do prices vary by brand, category, time, or channel?
2. Does traffic vary by day, time, or channel?
3. What are high-level metrics (Revenue, potential revenue, products, categories) by month, time, state, or channel?
4. What is the activity by brand or category, including brand preferences?
5. How does search behavior vary (e.g., brand search by category)?
6. What is the effect of special promotions on sales?
7. How do pricing fluctuations impact sales?

## Analysis and Deliverables
1. **Power BI Dashboards**:
   - Interactive visualizations for KPIs, pricing trends, promotion impacts, and search behavior.
   - Examples: Line charts for monthly revenue, bar charts for category-wise sales, and heatmaps for traffic by channel.
2. **Documentation**:
   - **Derived Variables**: Metrics like conversion rates, average order value, promotion-driven sales lift.
   - **Target Audience**: E-commerce managers, marketing teams, and product analysts.
   - **Value Generated**: Improved pricing strategies, optimized promotions, and enhanced customer targeting.
   - **Additional Data Suggestions**: Customer demographics, competitor pricing, and website/app performance metrics.

## Key Takeaways
- **Pricing Insights**: Identify optimal price points by analyzing variations across brands and channels.
- **Promotion Impact**: Quantify sales uplift from special promotions to prioritize high-impact campaigns.
- **Search Behavior**: Understand customer preferences to refine recommendation algorithms.
- **Traffic Patterns**: Optimize marketing efforts based on peak traffic times and channels.

## Usage
- **Prerequisites**: Power BI Desktop for viewing/editing dashboards.
- **Files**:
  - `Sales_Data_Ecommerce.csv`: Customer behavior dataset.
  - `Promotions.csv`: Promotion dataset.
  - `Ecommerce_Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI file with dashboards.
  - `Insights_Document.docx`: Detailed insights and answers to business questions.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Open `Ecommerce_Dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
  3. Review `Insights_Document.docx` for analysis summary.

## Notes
- The datasets require cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing formats) before analysis.
- The dashboards are designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter by time, channel, or category.
